Datasets and files related to my GOV1006 replication project of Troustine's *Segregation and Inequality in Public Goods (2016).*

This repo includes all datasets and original stata do files to replicate the main results as well as the results in the appendices. 

As noted in Troustine's original README for the replication data, 

"mainresults_(1).do" - generates all tables and figures in the main paper.

"on_line_appendix_.do" - generates all tables and figures in the on-line appendix.

"racial_polarization_winners.RData" - is used to produce Table 1

"fin_seg.RData" - is used to produce Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5, and Figure 1

"1970_2011_City_.RData" - is used to produce the figure in the on-line appendix.


The file "public_goods.Rmd" provides a summary of the paper and its key methods and findings.
